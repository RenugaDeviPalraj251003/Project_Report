This project aims at creating an SEO Analyzer Tool that can
evaluate and enhance the website content specifically focusing on search engine
optimization (SEO) factors. The tool is designed as a Flask web app, where
the users enter some URLs for the analysis. It conducts a detailed analysis
of basic SEO components that include meta description, heading tags, content
hierarchy and URL structure by crawling the HTML of the page provided. The
tool also offers concrete recommendations to help boost SEO which assists
them in raising their site rankings. Further, the project has interesting elements
like the incorporation of dark theme accessibility option and smooth scroll
navigation aimed at enhancing the user interface. A form validation system
ensures that the users input only usable URLs before they can run the analysis
mode, accompanied by a loading animation for whenever the system is working
on the given information. The analysis results are fed into a MongoDB database
enabling them to view their progress in SEO performance over a period of
time. This project outlines the significance of practical and efficient Search
Engine Optimization and the growing need for such a website for the purpose
of optimizing websites for the registrants and online marketers. The structure
of the tool is designed for improvements, including more sophisticated SEO
systems that may be integrated in the future.
