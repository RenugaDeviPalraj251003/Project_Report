This project aims at creating an SEO Analyzer Tool that can evaluate and enhance the website content specifically focusing on search engine optimization (SEO) factors. The tool is designed as a Flask web app, where the users enter some URLs for the analysis. It conducts a detailed analysis of basic SEO components that include meta description, heading tags, content hierarchy and URL structure by crawling the HTML of the page provided. The tool also offers concrete recommendations to help boost SEO which assists them in raising their site rankings. Further, the project has interesting elements like the incorporation of dark theme accessibility option and smooth scroll navigation aimed at enhancing the user interface. A form validation system ensures that the users input only usable URLs before they can run the analysis mode, accompanied by a loading animation for whenever the system is working on the given information. The analysis results are fed into a MongoDB database enabling them to view their progress in SEO performance over a period of time. This project outlines the significance of practical and efficient Search Engine Optimization and the growing need for such a website for the purpose of optimizing websites for the registrants and online marketers. The structure of the tool is designed for improvements, including more sophisticated SEO systems that may be integrated in the future.
